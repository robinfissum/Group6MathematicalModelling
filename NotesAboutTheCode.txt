The movie() - function from the py-pde module requires that
"FFmpeg" is installed and added to the system PATH environment variable.
(Internally the Movie class uses matplotlib.animation.FFMpegWriter., and its needs
to be added to PATH so that matplotlib can find it.)
To install it on Windows, you may follow the guide provided here:

NeuroEquation2d.py:
    -Solves the equation in the 2D case.
    - Code uses a modified version of:
    https://py-pde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples_gallery/pde_brusselator_class.html#sphx-glr-examples-gallery-pde-brusselator-class-py
    # Todo: We need to update the script with the correct parameter values(eta, eta_A, epsilon, epsilon_A)
    # Todo: Update this script with the correct domain dimensions (done in the grid object, and in the initial values
    for the scalar fields for N and R)

NeuroEquation3d.py:
    -Solves the equation in the 3D case.
    - Code uses a modified version of:
    https://py-pde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples_gallery/pde_brusselator_class.html#sphx-glr-examples-gallery-pde-brusselator-class-py
    # Todo: We need to update the script with the correct parameter values(eta, eta_A, epsilon, epsilon_A)
    # Todo: Update this script with the correct domain dimensions (done in the grid object, and in the initial values
    for the scalar fields for N and R)
    # Todo: Currently, the plot is only 2d, but the problem itself is 3d. Find a way to plot it in 3d,
    possibly by slicing the domain
