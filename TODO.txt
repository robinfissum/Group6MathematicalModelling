What we have to do:

Write in document: 
    - Deduction of equations?
    - Scaling of equations
    - Dimensionless constants
    - Dimensionless equation system with initial conditions and boundary conditions

Code: 
    - Make the system dimensionless
    - Initialize concentration matrices. For this we need the initial [dimensionless] concentrations
    - Create a solver: 
        - First we need the equations for the numerical scheme 
          (Crank nicolson with implicit reaction terms ?)
        - Once we have this, we need to read the values of the concentration matrices, and find a 
        way to turn this into a linear system that can be solved for the concentrations at the next 
        time step.
        - Solve this linear system
        - Put the values back into the concentration matrices
