####- Git and GitHub:
Git can be installed from: 
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

You may need to create a GitHub account on: https://github.com/

Once you have installed these, go into the Git Bash terminal and navigate into 
the directory you want to store the python project in. Some basic commands are: 

pwd : (print working directory) Shows where you are in the file tree

ls (or dir) : Shows files and folders in the current directory.

cd directoryname: Move form current directory to the directory named "directoryname" 

cd .. : Move back to previous directory (Note the space and the two dots)

Once you have moved into the desired directory, clone the project from GitHub by typing:

git clone https://github.com/robinfissum/Group6MathematicalModelling.git


You should now have the project at the specified location. 

#### - Coding together

For coding together in python, a nice option is to use Visual Studio Code, which can be 
downloaded from: https://code.visualstudio.com/

Once installed, you will need to download the extension called "Liveshare": 
Go to the menu on the left having four stacked boxes as its symbol and click on it. 
This opens the Extensions-Marketplace. Search for Live Share, and download this extension.
Once this is running, open your NTNU mail and look for a session invite. Copy the URL for the session 
and go back into VSCode. There should be a Live Share button on the top left menu (with the symbol of an 
arrow curving over a dot). Click this button and click "Join". You may need to click "Continue as guest" and enter
your name. Afterwards you need to enter the session link and press enter. 

After the host of the LiveShare session has accepted you into the session, you should now be able to 
program at the same time as the other group members.
